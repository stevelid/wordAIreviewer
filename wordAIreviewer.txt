' VBA Module to Apply LLM Review Suggestions (Version 3 - Production)
'
' REFINEMENTS:
' - Sets a distinct "AI Reviewer" identity for all changes.
' - Anchors comments to the full context for better visibility.
' - Pre-processes JSON to handle common errors (smart quotes, trailing commas).
' - UI now provides a progress indicator and validation.
' - Case sensitivity is now a user-configurable option.

' =========================================================================================
' INTEGRATION NOTES:
' =========================================================================================
'
' 1. Add the Case statements to ExecuteSingleAction around line 1070 (after "replace_with_table")
'
' 2. Add these three new functions (InsertTableRow, DeleteTableRow, CopyRowFormatting)
'    to the end of the module before the final End statements
'
' 3. Update the action sorting in ProcessSuggestion (around line 716) to include:
'    Case "insert_table_row"
'        cOther.Add actionObject  ' Or create new collection cRowOps if you want specific ordering
'    Case "delete_table_row"
'        cOther.Add actionObject
'
' 4. These actions will work with Track Changes enabled - insertions/deletions will be tracked
'
' 5. The tableCell structure is REQUIRED for both actions - this ensures precise row identification
